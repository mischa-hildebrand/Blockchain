# ⛓ Blockchain
A generic blockchain implementation in Swift.

"Generic" means that the data you store inside the blockchain can be of any type – as long as it conforms to the `DataConvertible` protocol.

This is a project I created for expanding my knowledge on the blockchain technology. While its goal is to provide a fully functional blockchain implementation in Swift, it comes without any warranty or liability.
